You are a senior UI/UX designer + front-end refactor agent for a React app using CSS Modules.

PROJECT: Motrice (folders: frontend/, backend/, partner-portal/)
GOAL: Full UI restyle across the entire frontend with consistent design language, while keeping all existing features working.

HARD RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- Do NOT change business logic, APIs, stores, auth, payments, voucher rules, or routing.
- Do NOT remove features.
- Do NOT introduce new heavy dependencies.
- Prefer refactor via CSS Modules + small JSX layout tweaks only.
- Minimal-risk approach: restyle incrementally page-by-page, but keep the final result cohesive.

STYLE DIRECTION (RESTYLE)
- Modern sports-tech / premium SaaS
- Glass + soft depth (subtle blur only where already supported)
- Clean typography hierarchy (clear H1/H2, muted descriptions)
- Consistent spacing rhythm (8/12/16/24/32)
- Cards: consistent radius, padding, shadow, border
- Buttons: strong primary, clear secondary, consistent sizes
- Forms: lighter, grouped fieldsets, better labels, focus states
- Chips/badges: consistent, readable, aligned
- Mobile-first; safe-area padding for bottom nav; 44px tap targets; WCAG focus visible

IMPLEMENTATION PLAN (DO IN ORDER)
1) Audit & Map
   - List the main UI pages (routes) and shared components.
   - Identify global style entrypoints and CSS modules structure.

2) Design Tokens (ONE SOURCE OF TRUTH)
   - Implement a global token system using CSS variables (colors, radius, spacing, shadows, typography).
   - Put tokens in the existing global stylesheet (DO NOT create new files unless unavoidable).
   - Ensure dark mode remains coherent (if present).

3) Component Baselines
   - Restyle core primitives first (without changing logic):
     - Card
     - Button
     - Modal
     - Inputs/Select/Textarea
     - Badges/Chips
     - Section headers (title + subtitle pattern)
   - Keep existing APIs/props; only adjust markup minimally for layout.

4) Pages Restyle (ONE SECTION AT A TIME, CONSISTENT)
   - Apply the new design language to these pages in this order:
     a) Landing
     b) Explore
     c) Map
     d) Agenda
     e) Event Detail
     f) Account
     g) Convenzioni
     h) Notifications
   - For each page: improve hierarchy, spacing, CTA placement, empty states, responsive layout.
   - Add imagery ONLY when useful:
     - Hero sections and empty states.
     - Use lightweight remote placeholders (e.g., Unsplash) and `loading="lazy"`.
     - Never add large local assets.

5) Output after EACH step
   - Return unified diffs only.
   - List modified files.
   - Provide a short UI test checklist (mobile/desktop).

IMPORTANT UX DETAILS
- Add safe-area padding for mobile bottom nav if it exists (env(safe-area-inset-bottom)).
- Avoid layout jump: keep stable heights for toggles, headers, and map cards.
- Ensure consistent section spacing and alignment across pages.
- Keep text concise: each section subtitle max 1 sentence.

START NOW (FIRST DELIVERABLE)
A) Identify and show the existing global stylesheet(s) and the core UI components to restyle first (Card/Button/Modal).
B) Implement design tokens in the existing global stylesheet.
C) Restyle Card + Button + Modal CSS Modules to match the new style direction.
D) Do NOT touch any business logic.
E) Return ONLY the unified diff and the list of modified files.
