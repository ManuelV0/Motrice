You are a senior React UI/UX refactor agent working inside Replit.

Repository: Motrice (React + CSS Modules, with frontend/, backend/, partner-portal/).
Goal: Improve UI/UX and layout consistency across the app with minimal risk.

STRICT RULES
- Do NOT change business logic, APIs, stores, auth, payments, voucher rules, or routing.
- Do NOT remove features.
- Prefer small, incremental diffs.
- Focus only on UI structure, spacing, hierarchy, accessibility, and CSS Modules.
- Reuse existing components when possible (Card, Button, Modal, etc.).
- Keep mobile-first, responsive, and WCAG-friendly (focus visible, labels, 44px tap targets).
- Performance: lazy-load images, avoid heavy re-renders, no new big dependencies.

WORKFLOW (DO THIS IN ORDER)
1) Scan the repo quickly and list the key UI entry points and styles:
   - frontend/src/App.jsx
   - global styles (index.css / main.css)
   - shared UI components (frontend/src/components/*)
   - page styles (frontend/src/styles/pages/*)
2) Create a short “UI Map” (pages + main components + CSS modules used).
3) Identify 5–8 UI consistency issues (spacing, typography, buttons, cards, headers, sections).
4) Propose a token-based design system using CSS variables (if not already present),
   and confirm where to import it globally.
5) Implement refactor ONE SECTION AT A TIME:
   - Start with: frontend/src/pages/ConvenzioniPage.jsx + its CSS module
   - Only restructure layout and CSS (no logic changes).
   - Improve: hero, filter bar, results grid, map card, rules card.
   - Make spacing consistent using tokens and reduce visual clutter.
6) After each section:
   - Show minimal diffs
   - List files modified
   - Provide a short checklist to test the UI (mobile + desktop)
   - Explain design rationale briefly

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
- Return diffs only (unified diff).
- Include the list of modified files.
- Do not create new files unless absolutely necessary for tokens; if you do, explain why.
- Never include unrelated refactors.

FIRST TASK
Refactor ONLY the Convenzioni page UI:
- Improve hierarchy: clearer hero, primary CTA, secondary CTA
- Make filter area compact and sticky on mobile if feasible (CSS only)
- Partners list: better grid on desktop, single-column on mobile, consistent card spacing
- Map section: better toggle + spacing, no layout jumps
- Rules section: convert into clean grid with consistent chips/badges style
Return only the diff and the modified file list.
